This project focuses on designing a curriculum for a new "Master of Business and Management in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence" program at the University of Toronto. Utilizing a dataset of 1800 job descriptions obtained through web scraping from Indeed, job postings for Data Scientists and Data Analysts were collected, cleaned, and analyzed. The data underwent exploratory analysis and feature engineering to identify relevant skills and their importance in the job market. Hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering algorithms were implemented to group similar skills and create course clusters. Visualization techniques such as dendrograms and scatterplots were employed to interpret the clustering results. Finally, the finalized course curriculum was based on the hierarchical clustering results, taking into account the flexibility and robustness of this approach. Furthermore, the characteristics of each cluster and suggested course names were generated using OpenAI's API ChatGPT3.5. The comprehensive curriculum is designed to align with industry demands and equip students for successful careers in data science and AI. Detailed course curriculum and clustering results are provided in the accompanying appendices.
